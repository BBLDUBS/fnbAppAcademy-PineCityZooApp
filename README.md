This is week 3 of the academy. The task is simple, create Pine City Zoo app from scratch! The contents of the app:
1. Home page: an index.html which is a map of the zoo.
2. Animals page: this page consists of the animals currently present in Pine City zoo and their descriptions.
3. Placas page: This page consists of places in the zoo, such as restaurants.
4. Bottom tabs: At the bottom of the app there is a feedback tab that links to a page where a visitor leaves a feedback for us.
